    two ways to implement:

    a. routes send status code only, use fetch in ejs to handle form submission, check status code and redirect to other page
    b. build more ejs files 

2. render to home with name

3. using findone vs using find decides whether you're returning an object or an array of object
    so when displaying in ejs, its <%= user[0].username %> with find and <%= user.username %> with findone
